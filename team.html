                <h3>HOW WE CREATED REKOH...</h3>
                <p>
                There are currently five REKOH shareholders, Isabella Brown, Casey Leyson, Darla Azul, Mellisa Oentardi and Frances Garcia. These are the five REKOH team members, who all contributed to the business through paying $20 each (making up $100). These five REKOH shareholders have therefore invested interest into the business, which has helped REKOH start up and sell our product within these early stages of business launch. These five shareholders are knowledgeable in understanding what the business needs, wants and aspires to achieve within the short and long term which is beneficial to REKOH in general and also REKOHs viability. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                Decision making process: 
                <br>
                    Firstly, REKOH will share draft ideas within the group to gather and understand all initial group perspectives, opinions and contributions regarding a given idea. For example - regarding selling, each member will talk about were they would like or think would be best to sell, as well as ideas around who is going to take responsibility for what, whose house we will bake at and the other decisions that need to be made around this topic. 
                    This can be done through any of our internal communication methods, however first preference agreed on by REKOH members is face to face or in class time. However, during covid-19 lockdown zoom calls are appropriate and fitting. And lastly during after school hours when a quick decision needs to be made before our next class period then digital social media messaging will be used. 
                <br>
                    Then, the group decides on a final, draft, choice or choices that make up one final action plan we all agree on. For example - We all agree to sell at a basketball game at Auckland Grammar on Saturday, with dedicated roles/responsibilities etc… 
                <br>
                    Then, this draft final decision(s) will be finalised and confirmed by the main role director who is responsible for the decision topic. This is a critical part to ensuring the practicality of this, and the extra factors we need to think about. For example - regarding finance, if we ran through ideas on how we handel our finances for the business activity, and decided on an individual REKOH bank account, then Darla will need to approve this based of her knowledge and vision for this section. 
                    If we get the go a ahead from the director, then we continue onto the next step. 
                    If not, then we re group and re gather all other feasible ideas. 
                <br>
                    Next, we discuss developed and almost finalised ideas with our two given mentors, each of which will offer there own advice and feedback to help us improve or simply continue in our tracks regarding this idea. 
                    If feedback and ideas is given by mentors, then the main role director will suggest how we make changes through communication with all other REKOH members. Once these changes have been made and all REKOH members confirm, but importantly the main role director confirms and clears the final idea(s)/choice(s) being decided, then we move onto our final step. 
                <br>
                    This ideal is then finalised and REKOH will implement this into the business operations, production and/or business plan.
