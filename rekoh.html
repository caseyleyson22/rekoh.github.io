                <h3>WHY CHOOSE REKOH?</h3>
                <p>
                REKOH has developed a practical resource that can be easily attained, and consumed, for those who lack sufficient nutrients and knowledge to recover properly after physical activity and a workout where vital supplements are unknowingly lost.
                REKOH is ensuring that the customer’s well being is improved by offering a nutrition bar that refuels people's bodies with sufficient minerals, vitamins, and supplements. This not only gives their body the nutrients it needs to better recover (physical), but it will also positively enhance their mental and emotional well being (mood) as proper food is being consumed, putting the person into a good mental state. Socially they will be contributing to their sports teams with improved performance, and then spiritually they would then achieve their goals to their full potential. This means their overall well being can be positively enhanced by consuming REKOHs nutritional recovery bar.
